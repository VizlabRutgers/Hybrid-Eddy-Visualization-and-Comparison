# Hybrid-Eddy-Visualization-and-Comparison
This is the Eddy visualization code for the hybrid eddy detection and also compare with winding angle and hybrid approach in this paper:https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08229.  

The hybrid eddy detection approach is here: https://github.com/VizlabRutgers/Hybrid-Eddy-detection  
The winding angle detection approach is here: https://github.com/dougcahl/eddy_identification_winding  
The OW eddy detection approach is here: https://github.com/VizlabRutgers/Feature_Tracking
