# Hybrid-Eddy-Visualization-and-Comparison
This is the Eddy visualization code for the hybrid eddy detection and also compare with winding angle and hybrid approach in this paper: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.08229

For the comarison, you need the hybrid eddy detection, OW eddy detection and winding angle eddy detection data.

The hybrid eddy detection approach is here: https://github.com/VizlabRutgers/Hybrid-Eddy-detection  
The winding angle detection approach is here: https://github.com/dougcahl/eddy_identification_winding  
The OW eddy detection approach is here: https://github.com/VizlabRutgers/Feature_Tracking  

The dataset presented here in the demo is released here: https://kaust-vislab.github.io/SciVis2020/



# Usage
1. Download the matlab code
2. Create the 3D seabed information (we use Red Sea dataset as a example)
3. Run Multiple eddy detection approaches.
4. Set the data path and configuration at the beginning of the eddyStat.m file.
5. Run the matlab program (It can create video)
